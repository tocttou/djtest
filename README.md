## OpenCV pipeline builder

Online pipeline builder for OpenCV.

### This project was made as a toy task for GSoC application to CloudCV.
New functions can be added easily and the number is only limited by the current UI of the app. I do not intend to take it any further. This repository is for anyone looking for a reference.

## Setup

`apt-get install python-dev`

`apt-get install libopencv-dev python-opencv`

`pip install django`

`pip install django_compressor`

`pip install django-appconf`

`apt-get install ruby`

`gem install compass`

Launch the app with `python manage.py runserver` and go to http:localhost:8000/home/ to access the page.
